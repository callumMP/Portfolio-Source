# Website URL
The website is published through Netlify and the URL is:
https://jovial-borg-398b17.netlify.app/index.html 

# GitHub
My GitHub repository is https://github.com/callumMP/Portfolio-Source.

This github repository was only created on the 13th of March due to issues with deploying to Netlify. I created a new repository without folders and that seemed to fix my issue. 

# Purpose

   The purpose of my website is to create an appealing portfolio that can be easily be updated as I learn new skills and complete more projects. Currently it serves to teach people about my interests. 

# Functionality / features
    The site uses basic HTML and CSS with a emphasis on interesting but simple animations. I tried to take advantage of using the online platform to show effects that can't be done in print media.

# Target audience
The target audience of my site is both peers and employers. In its current state though, it will most likely only be visited by educators and housemates. 

# Tech Stack  
The Tech stack used was HTML, CSS, GIT and it was deployed using Netlify.

# Commit Log
Unfortunately, I had to delete my past git repository to make Netlify work so my commits are limited to the 13th onwards.
